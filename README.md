## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

### What I learned

For this project i choose to use the basic html css ans js, and not include any framework. Doing that has helped appreciate how modern day frameworks and library helped made our life easier.For example when i was trying to remove extentions and filter extension base on it state, if it is active or not, it would have be five times easier and faster to do it with react.

It was a fine experience so far.
